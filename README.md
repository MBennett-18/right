Rational Integration of Genomic Healthcare Testing (RIGHT)
==========================================================

This project explores the development of rational cost-effective
strategies for integrating multiplexed genomic information
into clinical practice.

Simulations of a patient population are done using the R package
simmer, with a variety of testing scenarios.

The goals of this code base in the RIGHT project are as follows:

  * Create a web based calculator (currently using Shiny)
  * Create a reference implementation in R's simmer
  * Create simmer boilerplate code that makes adding events simple.
